Code dump for Cambrian Raymond Quarry network analysis project.

The primary data were collected from the Raymond Quarry in the main Burgess Shale site, located ~5 km north of Field, British Columbia, Canada, on a ridge connecting Mt. Field and Wapta Mountain ('Fossil Ridge'). Other exposures are known (Collins et al. 1983), including outcrops on Mt. Stephen that are lithologically and biostratigraphically equivalent to the Raymond Quarry Member (Fletcher and Collins 1998), such as the outcrops of equivalent strata and fossils across the Kicking Horse Valley on the shoulder of Mt. Stephen (Fletcher and Collins 1998). Consequently, the discussed fauna was not geographically isolated. Moreover, the Raymond Quarry fauna also appears to be autochthonous. 
Vertical bedding measurements were determined from an arbitrarily assigned RQ 10.0 m level (equivalent to 21.6 m above the base of C.D. Walcott's excavations in the Phyllopod Bed). All fossils were labelled according to the bed of occurrence, to the nearest 10cm. Specimens that occurred exactly between two measured levels were assigned to the higher level.

The code in this repository is part of the full code to analyse the said dataset. The data and the full code is available upon request to the authors (email: answain@umd.edu) or upon the publication of the work. After gaining access to the dataset, if you are unable to run any part of the code, please do not hesitate to contact.
